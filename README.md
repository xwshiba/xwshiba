### My Projects - feel free to try them!
- 📘 [Kindle Scraper for Mandarin System](https://github.com/xwshiba/kindle_scraper_zh)<br>
  --> A life-saving Python tool to organize Kindle's notorious `My Clippings.txt`.<br>
  --> Only supports Mandarin System for now. English version coming soon.
  
- 💬 [SimpleChatRoom](https://github.com/xwshiba/SimpleChatRoom)<br>

  --> Hawkhacks Hackathon Project.<br>
  --> A responsive web app that facilitates user interaction with AI models from OpenAI. Users can interact the AI chat bot to ask for translation, recipes, stories, and more.<br>
